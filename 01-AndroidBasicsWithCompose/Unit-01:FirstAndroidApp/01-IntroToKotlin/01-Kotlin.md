- First Program

```kt
fun main() {
    println("Hello World!")
}
```

- A Kotlin program requires a `main` function as the entry point of the program.
- To define a function in Kotlin, use the `fun` keyword, followed by the name of the function, any inputs enclosed in parentheses, followed by the function body enclosed in curly braces.
