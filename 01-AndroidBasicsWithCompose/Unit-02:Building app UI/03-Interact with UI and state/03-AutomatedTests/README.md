# Automated Tests

## Type of automated tests

### Local tests

- Local tests are a type of automated test that directly test a small piece of code to ensure that it functions properly.
- With local tests, you can test functions, classes, and properties. Local tests are executed on your workstation, which means they run in a development environment without the need for a device or emulator.

### Instrumentation tests

- For Android development, an instrumentation test is a UI test.
- Instrumentation tests let you test parts of an app that depend on the Android API, and its platform APIs and services.
- Unlike local tests, UI tests launch an app or part of an app, simulate user interactions, and check whether the app reacted appropriately. Throughout this course, UI tests are run on a physical device or emulator.
