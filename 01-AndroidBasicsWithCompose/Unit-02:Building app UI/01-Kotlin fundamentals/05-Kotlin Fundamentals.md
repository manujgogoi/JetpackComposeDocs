# Kotlin Fundamentals

## Mobile Notifications

Write a program that prints the summary message based on the number of notifications that you received. The message should include:

- The exact number of notifications when there are less than 100 notifications.
- `99+` as the number of notifications when there are 100 notifications or more.

```kt
fun main() {
    val morningNotification = 51
    val eveningNotification = 135

    printNotificationSummary(morningNotification)
    printNotificationSummary(eveningNotification)
}


fun printNotificationSummary(numberOfMessages: Int) {
    if (numberOfMessages < 100) {
        println("You have ${numberOfMessages} notifications.")
    } else {
        println("Your phone is blowing up! You have 99+ notifications.")
    }
}
```

## Movie-ticket price

Movie tickets are typically priced differently based on the age of moviegoers.

- A children's ticket price of $15 for people 12 years old or younger.
- A standard ticket price of $30 for people between 13 and 60 years old. On Mondays, discount the standard ticket price to $25 for this same age group.
- A senior ticket price of $20 for people 61 years old and older. Assume that the maximum age of a moviegoer is 100 years old.
- A `-1` value to indicate that the price is invalid when a user inputs an age outside of the age specifications.

```kt
fun main() {
    val child = 5
    val adult = 28
    val senior = 87

    val isMonday = true

    println("The movie ticket price for a person aged $child is \$${ticketPrice(child, isMonday)}.")
    println("The movie ticket price for a person aged $adult is \$${ticketPrice(adult, isMonday)}.")
    println("The movie ticket price for a person aged $senior is \$${ticketPrice(senior, isMonday)}.")
}

fun ticketPrice(age: Int, isMonday: Boolean): Int {
    return when(age) {
        in 0..12 -> 15
        in 13..60 -> if (isMonday) 25 else 30
        in 61..100 -> 20
        else -> -1
    }
}
```

## Temperature converter

There are three main temperature scales used in the world: **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Kelvin**. Write a program that converts a temperature from one scale to another with these formulas:

- Celsius to Fahrenheit: 째 F = 9/5 (째 C) + 32
- Kelvin to Celsius: 째 C = K - 273.15
- Fahrenheit to Kelvin: K = 5/9 (째 F - 32) + 273.15

```kt
fun main() {
    printFinalTemperature(27.0, "Celsius", "Fahrenheit") { 9.0 / 5.0 * it + 32 }
    printFinalTemperature(350.0, "Kelvin", "Celsius") { it - 273.15 }
    printFinalTemperature(10.0, "Fahrenheit", "Kelvin") { 5.0 / 9.0 * (it - 32) + 273.15 }
}


fun printFinalTemperature(
    initialMeasurement: Double,
    initialUnit: String,
    finalUnit: String,
    conversionFormula: (Double) -> Double
) {
    val finalMeasurement = String.format("%.2f", conversionFormula(initialMeasurement)) // two decimal places
    println("$initialMeasurement degrees $initialUnit is $finalMeasurement degrees $finalUnit.")
}
```

## Song catalog

Create a class that can represent the structure of a song. The Song class must include these code elements:

- Properties for the title, artist, year published, and play count
- A property that indicates whether the song is popular. If the play count is less than 1,000, consider it unpopular.
- A method that prints a song description in this format:

  "[Title], performed by [artist], was released in [year published]."

```kt
fun main() {
    val brunoSong = Song("We Don't Talk About Bruno", "Encanto Cast", 2022, 1_000_000)
    brunoSong.printDescription()
    println(brunoSong.isPopular)
}


class Song(
    val title: String,
    val artist: String,
    val yearPublished: Int,
    val playCount: Int
){
    val isPopular: Boolean
        get() = playCount >= 1000

    fun printDescription() {
        println("$title, performed by $artist, was released in $yearPublished.")
    }
}
```

Output:

```bash
We Don't Talk About Bruno, performed by Encanto Cast, was released in 2022.
true
```

## Internet profile

Write a program which prints out a person's profile details

```kt
fun main() {
    val amanda = Person("Amanda", 33, "play tennis", null)
    val atiqah = Person("Atiqah", 28, "climb", amanda)

    amanda.showProfile()
    atiqah.showProfile()
}


class Person(val name: String, val age: Int, val hobby: String?, val referrer: Person?) {
    fun showProfile() {
        println("Name: $name")
        println("Age: $age")
        if(hobby != null) {
            print("Likes to $hobby. ")
        }
        if(referrer != null) {
            print("Has a referrer named ${referrer.name}")
            if(referrer.hobby != null) {
                print(", who likes to ${referrer.hobby}.")
            } else {
                print(".")
            }
        } else {
            print("Doesn't have a referrer.")
        }
        print("\n\n")
    }
}
```

## Foldable phones

Write a `FoldablePhone` class that inherits from the `Phone` class. It should contain the following:

- A property that indicates whether the phone is folded.
- A different `switchOn()` function behavior than the `Phone` class so that it only turns the screen on when the phone isn't folded.
- Methods to change the folding state.

```kt
open class Phone(var isScreenLightOn: Boolean = false){
    open fun switchOn() {
        isScreenLightOn = true
    }

    fun switchOff() {
        isScreenLightOn = false
    }

    fun checkPhoneScreenLight() {
        val phoneScreenLight = if (isScreenLightOn) "on" else "off"
        println("The phone screen's light is $phoneScreenLight.")
    }
}

class FoldablePhone(var isFolded: Boolean = true): Phone() {
    override fun switchOn() {
        if (!isFolded) {
            isScreenLightOn = true
        }
    }

    fun fold() {
        isFolded = true
    }

    fun unfold() {
        isFolded = false
    }
}

fun main() {
    val newFoldablePhone = FoldablePhone()

    newFoldablePhone.switchOn()
    newFoldablePhone.checkPhoneScreenLight()
    newFoldablePhone.unfold()
    newFoldablePhone.switchOn()
    newFoldablePhone.checkPhoneScreenLight()
}
```

Output:

```bash
The phone screen's light is off.
The phone screen's light is on.
```

## Special auction

Typically in an auction, the highest bidder determines the price of an item. In this special auction, if there's no bidder for an item, the item is automatically sold to the auction house at the minimum price.

```kt
fun main() {
    val winningBid = Bid(5000, "Private Collector")

    println("Item A is sold at ${auctionPrice(winningBid, 2000)}.")
    println("Item B is sold at ${auctionPrice(null, 3000)}.")
}

class Bid(val amount: Int, val bidder: String)

fun auctionPrice(bid: Bid?, minimumPrice: Int): Int {
    return bid?.amount ?: minimumPrice
}
```
